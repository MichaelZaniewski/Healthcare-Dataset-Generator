# Healthcare-Dataset-Generator
A Python-based generator that creates unique relational healthcare datasets for analytics and machine learning. The generator programmatically creates realistic, U.S.-based healthcare data that mirrors hospital operations â€” 
with **no real or sensitive data**. Each run is randomized under strict rules, so **no two datasets are identical**.
